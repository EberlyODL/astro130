<div><strong>Q:&nbsp;How many galaxies have a super-massive black holes (SMBH) in their centers?</strong>
</div>
<div>A:&nbsp;All galaxies, except for some dwarf galaxies, have supermassive black holes at their centers.
</div>
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: How many of these are active black holes?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: Most likely all the supermassive black holes are swallowing some matter.&nbsp; However only a small fraction ( about 10%) are VERY active and are called AGN.
</div>
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: What are the typical masses for the super-massive&nbsp;black holes in centers of galaxies?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: 10<sup>6</sup> – 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>
</div>
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: What distinguishes an active galaxy, that is, one with an active
  <br>galactic nucleus, from a normal galaxy?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: See pages 113-115, jets, strong emission over a broad range in wavelengths (nonthermal spectra), some are 100 times&nbsp;brighter than the rest of the galaxy;&nbsp;AGN can produce the equivalent of the power of an entire galaxy within the size of the solar&nbsp;system.)
  <br>
  <br><strong>Q: On what time scale does the brightness of an AGN vary? What does that
  <br>say about the size of the emitting region?</strong>
</div>
A: The variability is on the order of months, hence they must be
  <br>very compact (see page 115).
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: What causes the large lobes seen in radio waves?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: Jets and their interaction with the intergalactic gas. See page 111 and several pages afterwards.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: How is an AGN spectrum different from a black body spectrum?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: An AGN has emission at all wavelengths!&nbsp; See figure on page 116.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  <br><strong>Q: What is the unification scheme?</strong>
</div>
<div>A: See figure on page 123.
  <br>
  <br><strong>Q: What is the typical age of an AGN?</strong>
</div>
<p>A: 100 million years, 1% age of the universe, since 1% are seen to be active at any one time.
</p>
<p>All galaxies, except for some dwarf galaxies, have supermassive black holes at their centers. Since we only see quasars in the past, and yet most galaxies have black holes in their centers, we can conclude that <strong><em>all galaxies may have passed through a quasar-like stage earlier in time.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What are common/general characteristics of AGN? </strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) All have some sort of “star-like” object at their very centers, that dominates the galaxies’ luminosities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) They are all quite a bit more luminous than normal galaxies (by factors of 10-1000) and are therefore all thought to involve central, supermassive black holes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) All show radiation over a wide range of wavelengths (not like typical galaxies which have thermal radiation).
</p>
<p>A large variety of AGN have been discovered (Seyfert, Quasars, Bl Lac objects). <strong>What powers the active galactic nuclei? </strong>
</p>
<p>Their radiation is not created by stars, but is powered by the <strong>central supermassive black hole </strong>and the radiation is concentrated in the nucleus. The activity comes from matter falling into the black hole.
</p>
<p><strong>What is the source of the difference between normal galaxies and active galaxies?</strong>
</p>
<p>The accretion disk fuels the central power source in AGN, and if there is no fuel or not enough fuel, then the galaxy will not be seen as an AGN.
</p>
<p>When we look at AGN in detail, it appears that many of them show evidence for the host galaxy absorbing another galaxy.
</p>
<p><strong>Where does the material that forms an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole come from? </strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since most AGN are undergoing some sort of galaxy interactions, the gas in the galaxy is disrupted and it can funnel to the core, providing fuel to power the supermassive black hole.
</p>
<p><strong>Can an AGN run out of fuel?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, as galaxies age, less gas is available because stars are forming and using up the available material. If there is no more material available around the central supermassive black hole, the AGN will no longer be active and will then, look like a regular galaxy.
</p>
<p><strong>Can activity restart? </strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, if the nucleus gets new supply of material, usually through mergers with other galaxies.
</p>
<p><strong>What is the “era of quasars?”</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not observe any quasars nearby (in other words in the current age of the universe).&nbsp; However, observations suggests that quasars were a thousand times more common when the universe was ~2 billion years old.&nbsp; This implies that a quasar may actually be a phase in the evolution of galaxies. During the quasar era galaxies were closer together, and would experience more encounters with other galaxies. Such encounters can disrupt the gas within galaxies and funnel it to the center where they would feed the central “engine” of the quasar.
</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the distinctive features that can indicate the presence of a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy?</strong>
</p>
<p>Observe <strong>two or more</strong> of these features to find a black hole:
</p>
<p>• <strong>Gravitational deflection of light</strong>, by an amount requiring black hole masses and sizes.
</p>
<p>• <strong>X-ray and/or g-ray emission</strong> from ionized gas falling into the black hole.
</p>
<p>• <strong>Orbital motion of nearby stars or gas clouds</strong> that can be used to infer the mass of a black hole.
</p>
<p>• <strong>Motion close to the speed of light</strong>, or apparently greater than the speed of light (“superluminal motion”).
</p>
<p>• <strong>Extremely large luminosity</strong> that cannot be explained easily by normal stellar energy generation.
</p>
<p>• Direct observation of a large, massive <strong>accretion disk</strong>.
