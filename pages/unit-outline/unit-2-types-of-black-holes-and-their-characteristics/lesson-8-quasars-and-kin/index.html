<p><strong>Active galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN)</strong></p>
<p>If the center of a galaxy is unusually bright, we call it an&nbsp;<strong> <em>active galactic nucleus</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Quasars are the most luminous examples. Many active galaxies have jets, and most show signs of interactions with other galaxies. Sometimes they appear disturbed by collisions, and other times interactions cause bursts of star formation.</p>
<p><u>Characteristics of Active Galaxies</u></p>
<ol><li>AGN luminosities can be enormous (>10<sup>12</sup> <em>L</em><sub>Sun</sub>).</li><li>AGN luminosities can rapidly vary (come from a space smaller than solar system).</li><li>ANG emit energy over a wide range of wavelengths (contain matter with a wide temperature range), non-thermal radiation.</li><li>Some galaxies drive<strong> jets </strong>of plasma at near light speed. Jets are thought to come from twisting of the magnetic field lines in the inner part of accretion disk.</li></ol>

<p>The leading theory for the energy source in an active galactic nucleus is <strong><em>a supermassive black hole, surrounded by an accretion disk. </em></strong>The strong <strong>magnetic field lines </strong>around the black hole <strong>channel particles into jets</strong> perpendicular to the magnetic axis. When particles are accelerated by spiraling along the&nbsp;magnetic field lines they produce energy&nbsp;that we call&nbsp;synchrotron radiation.</p>
<p>In an active galaxy, the central black hole may be as massive as billions of solar masses.</p>
