<p>These kinds of galaxies have active nuclei:
</p>
<p>1) Quasars
</p>
<p>2) Seyfert galaxies
</p>
<p>3) Radio galaxies
</p>
<p>4) “Blazars” (a.k.a. BL Lacertae objects; very compact quasars)
</p>
<p>We know tens of thousands of them, but active galaxies are vastly outnumbered by normal galaxies.
</p>
<p>1) <strong><span class="purple-text"><span class="teal-text">Quasars</span></span> </strong>– quasi-stellar objects – are starlike in appearance. <strong>However quasars are actually active galactic nuclei, not stars. </strong>Quasar spectra are enormously redshifted. Thus, quasars must be among the most luminous objects, to be visible over such enormous distances.
</p>
<p>From brightness and distance measurements we find that luminosities of some quasars are greater than 10<sup>12</sup> <em>L</em><sub>Sun</sub>. Their variability shows that all this energy comes from a region smaller than our solar system!
</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristics of a quasar:
</p>
<ul><li>Starlike galaxy nucleus with extremely large luminosity.</li><li>One-sided jet.</li>
</ul>

  <br>The quasar (upper left) is starlike and much brighter than anything else in the image. No “counter jet” is seen on the other side of the quasar from the jet in this image.

<p>This is another famous quasar, M87.&nbsp; The image was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. Notice the multiple knots in the jet.

<p>2)<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="purple-text">Seyfert galaxies&nbsp;</span> </strong>resemble normal spiral galaxies, but their cores are thousands of times more luminous and the core must be extremely compact.
</p>
<p>3) <strong><span class="deep-purple-text">Radio Galaxies</span></strong>
</p>
<p>- Discovered by radio astronomers in the 1950s: large, emit very strongly in the radio portion of the spectrum.
</p>
<p>- Identified with visible galaxies: a galaxy&nbsp;is <em>always</em> seen to lie in between the two bright radio spots. &nbsp;The brightest radio galaxies are usually elliptical galaxies.
</p>
<p>- <strong>Jets</strong>: beginning in the 1970s, detailed radio images revealed that all radio galaxies have jets&nbsp;originating in the center of the galaxy&nbsp;and reaching out to the brighter radio spots. In contrast to quasars, most radio galaxies have two jets that are easily detectable&nbsp;and always oppositely-directed. <em>One jet is usually brighter</em> than the other by a large factor.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Here is <strong>the archetypical radio galaxy, Cygnus A</strong>. Not to be confused with Cygnus X-1.
</p>

<p>Visible-light image, from the HST-WFPC2 archives.
</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of a typical radio galaxy:
</p>
<p><img src="assets/untitled6.png" width="633" height="346" alt="">
</p>
<p>Notice the different parts: <span class="deep-purple-text"><strong>lobes, jets, hot spots </strong>and<strong> core</strong></span>.
</p>
<p>The lobes in Cygnus A image are many times larger than the galaxy that we see in the visible wavelengths. The lobes appear at the end of jets and they exert gas shocks on the intergalactic medium (warm-hot gas found between galaxies).
</p>
<p>In this Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image of the radio galaxy NGC 4261, you can see the inner thin accretion disk that is surrounded by a dusty torus, all enveloping the central black hole.
</p>
<p><img src="assets/untitled7.png" width="900" height="565" alt="">
</p>
<p>Check out the figure on page 123 in the textbook for a more extensive explanation for a structure of a typical AGN.
</p>
<p>With the Hubble Space Telescope, it has become possible to measure the masses of some radio-galaxy central black holes directly, by observing the Doppler shifts of gas clouds nearby.
</p>
<p>- M84, classic radio galaxy: Doppler shifts corresponding to rotational speeds of 400 km/sec, only 26 light years from the center of the galaxy. This indicates a central mass of&nbsp; 3x10<sup>8</sup> <em>M<sub>Sun</sub></em>&nbsp;- again, a supermassive black hole. This is thought to be typical of the masses of radio-galaxy black holes. Note that is similar to the masses of quasar black holes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>4) “<span class="green-text"><strong>Blazars</strong></span>” (a.k.a. BL Lacertae objects; very compact quasars)
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>These AGN are bright and starlike. Only recently has very faint luminosity been detected around them to indicate that they are the nuclei of galaxies.
</p>
<p>They have a smooth spectrum (almost no spectral lines) and it is hard to measure a Doppler shift from it. Thus it was not realized at first that these objects were far enough away to be galaxy nuclei.
</p>
<ul><li>Most are strong point-like <em>radio </em>sources.</li><li><strong>Violently variable brightness</strong>: large luminosity produced in a very small volume. (Sounds like a quasar so far.)</li><li>No jets seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Quasars, radio galaxies and blazars are the same thing, seen from different angles.</em></strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
</p>
<p>If the jets are relativistic (speeds close to <em>c</em>) then their brightness should increase the closer to “head on” they are viewed, and decrease if they recede from the observer.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If viewed straight down the jet, the vicinity of the central “engine” as well as the amplified, approaching jet would not be obscured by the disk. The brightness may be highly variable as a result.
</p>
<p>-Quasars: radio galaxy jets viewed closer to head-on.
</p>
<p>-Blazars: radio galaxy jets viewed very nearly head on.
</p>
<p>An observer (dog) whose line of sight makes a small angle with the jet would see the object as a <strong>quasar</strong>. (For an extremely small angle, it appears as a <strong>blazar</strong>.)
</p>
<p>An observer (cat) whose line of sight is closer to perpendicular to the jet would see the object as a <strong>radio</strong> galaxy.
</p>

</p>
<p>It is possible to predict from these suggestions what the relative numbers of quasars, radio galaxies and blazars should be. Observations confirm this prediction.
