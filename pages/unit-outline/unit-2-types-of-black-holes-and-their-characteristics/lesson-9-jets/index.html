<p>A minimal reading would be the first page, the images on pp 134, 136, 140(lower), 141, and everything from p148 to the end. One could add to that pp133-134 on shocks and synchrotron emission, and pp138 (last paragraph) to p144 on the interaction of jets with the intergalactic medium.</p>
<div class="question"><p>Which of the following is the correct answer?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Are jets unique to black holes?</a>
<p><strong>No, protostars, possibly neutron stars too have them. (p128, p157).</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is a radio interferometer?</a>
<p><strong>pp 129-131</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">How fast is the gas in a jet moving outward?</a>
<p><strong>Within 1% of c, p128</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What do the jets look like in radio wavelengths?</a>
<p><strong>Figure on p134.</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What makes the jet emit in radio wavelengths?</a>
<p><strong>Interaction with Intergalactic medium, shock leads to relativistic electrons and magnetic fields; magnetic field lines can accelerate particles via synchrotron radiation, p133-134.</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">The name "jet" implies an outflowing stream of gas. What is the evidence that the gas really is streaming outward?</a>
<p><strong>SS433, p137</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is the evidence that jets interact with the surrounding Intergalactic medium?</a>
<p><strong>Jets bend as the galaxy moves through the medium, p 142-143, see figures on p140,141,143.</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What's a typical age for these jets?</a>
<p><strong>300 million years, p142</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is superluminal motion? What is going on?</a>
<p><strong>It is an illusion, p149, figure on p150.</strong></p></li></ol></div>
