<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Light path B is shorter than path A.</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> If the knot’s speed is close to the speed of light, B is almost a light-year shorter than A. This “head start” makes the light arrive sooner than expected, giving the </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">appearance</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> that the knot is moving faster than light.&nbsp; (Nothing </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">actually</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> needs to move that fast for the knot to </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">appear</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> to move that fast.) Thus apparent speeds larger than the speed of light can be obtained. The apparent speeds only turn out to be much in excess of the speed of light if </span><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">the actual speed of the radio-emitting knots is pretty close to the speed of light</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">.</span></p>
<p>Ejection speeds in astrophysics tend to be close to the <strong>escape speed</strong> of the object that did the ejecting. What has escape speeds near the speed of light?</p>
<ul><li>Neutron stars (but they can’t produce the quasar’s luminosity)</li><li><strong>Black holes</strong> - like the ones that can produce the quasars’ luminosities.</li></ul>
<div><br><strong>Why is it that often a jet is seen on only one side?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Because of <strong><em><span class="pink-text">relativistic beaming</span></em></strong>, or headlight effect, see figure on p152.<br><br><strong>What likely accelerates and collimates jets?</strong></div>
<div>Wound up magnetic fields, p 154.<br><br><strong>Can the spin of the black hole be a source of energy for accelerating a jet?</strong></div>
<div>Yes, p158.</div>
