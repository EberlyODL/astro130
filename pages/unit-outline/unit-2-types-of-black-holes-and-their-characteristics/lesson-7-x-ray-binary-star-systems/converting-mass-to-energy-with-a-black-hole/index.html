<p>As matter falls onto a black hole, it is&nbsp;ionized&nbsp;and accelerated to speeds close to that of light, and the matter radiates light as it accelerates.</p>
<p>The faster the infalling matter goes, the higher the energy of the photons.</p>
<p>The surface of planets or stars would stop an in falling particle before it approached the speed of light, but such speeds are possible when falling into a black hole.</p>
<p>Below is an illustration of what sort of radiation is produced by matter falling onto increasingly dense objects.</p>

<p>X-rays and Gamma rays can only be produced when matter is falling onto a blackhole.</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">How much energy does accretion release?</a>
<p>The infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy up to several tenths of its rest mass in form of X-rays. About 10% of the rest mass of in falling particles can be turned into energy in the form of light in this manner. (The other 90% is added to the mass of the black hole.) &nbsp;For reference, Hydrogen fusion releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass. &nbsp;So gravity around a black hole can actually produce much more energy than nuclear fusion reactions in stars. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is the name of the first&nbsp;BH candidate discovered?</a>
<p>Cygnus X-1 (this means that it is a star in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan).</p></li></ol></div>

<p>The brightest star in this image is orbiting around a black hole every 5.6 days. The black hole itself cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Cygnus X-1 is one of the first X-ray sources discovered. &nbsp;Its optical counterpart is a massive star (visible in the image bellow). The star itself is unable to account for observed X-ray radiation. &nbsp;However, through Doppler shift of spectral lines, we inferred that this star has a binary companion. &nbsp;The companion is dark in optical but bright in X-rays.</p>
<p>SDSS image; Cyg X-1 is located near large active regions of star formation in the Milky Way, as seen in this image that spans some 700 light years across.</p>

<p><img src="assets/binary_companion.jpg" width="432" height="238" alt="">Artist illustration; The black hole pulls material from a massive, blue companion star toward it. This material forms a disk (shown in red and orange) that rotates around the black hole before falling into it or being redirected away from the black hole in the form of powerful jets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The mass of Cygnus X-1 Mass: 14.8 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;(from optical observations of the companion star’s motion).</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">How is it possible for a blue main sequence star (fusing H --> He in the core) to be more massive that its binary companion that is a red giant star?</a>
<p>Look up the Algol paradox example in the book on page 61.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What happens to a binary star system if one star explodes as a supernova?</a>
<p>1) If the exploding star is the more massive one, then the less massive star will be flung into space.</p>
<p>2) If the exploding star is the less massive one, the more massive star in the binary will stay intact.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">Can we distinguish a black hole from a neutron star?</a>
<p>Accretion signatures from a BH vs. a neutron star should be different since a neutron star&nbsp;has a surface&nbsp;–&nbsp;would see a ‘splash’. &nbsp;A BH doesn’t have a surface so the material from&nbsp;the last stable orbit would not make a splash as it crosses the event horizon and we wouldn’t see it.&nbsp;We have not yet observed such difference in accretion.</p>
<p>The only way to tell black holes and neutron stars apart in X-ray binaries is to confirm that the mass of the unseen star is larger than 3 M<sub>sun</sub>. &nbsp;If the star is less massive, then it must be a neutron star.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What happens if a White Dwarf accretes so much matter that it exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M<sub>sun?</sub></a>
<p>The white dwarf will blow up in a supernova explosion. &nbsp;No star remains afterwards.</p></li></ol></div>
