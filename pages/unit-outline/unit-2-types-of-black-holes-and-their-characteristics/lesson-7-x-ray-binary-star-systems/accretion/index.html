<p>&nbsp;“The infall of gas onto a star or other gravitating system is called accretion.” [Begelman & Reese]&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can think of accretion as swallowing of gas. Gas that falls onto a black hole or a neutron star&nbsp;almost never falls straight into&nbsp;the black hole. &nbsp;It actually spirals&nbsp;inward. This is because the gas coming from a regular star in the binary system carries angular momentum. The matter that falls onto a compact member of the binary system will look like a flattened whirlpool&nbsp;–&nbsp;an accretion disk. &nbsp;This is similar to water going down the drain, the swirling water must give up angular momentum to go down the drain. The way that the gas looses angular momentum in an accretion disk is through friction. &nbsp;In other words, the gas in an accretion disk is heated.</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Why does gas get heated when it is accreting?</a>
<p>The inner parts of the accretion disk orbit faster than the outer parts. This exerts a drag onto the inner parts and they loose energy through friction. The loss of energy in this way is the only reason that the gas would fall inwards.</p></li></ol></div>
