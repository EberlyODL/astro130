<p>By stellar-mass we mean black holes formed by the gravitational collapse of dead stars that are too massive to become neutron stars or white dwarfs.</p>
<p>1) High-energy light such as X or Gamma&nbsp;rays give us&nbsp;promising, but not completely unambiguous, detections of black holes.</p>
<p>2) Orbital motion of companion stars&nbsp;- orbit size, speed, plus Newton’s laws can be used to work out the mass of an unseen companion (sometimes bright in X-ray). &nbsp;If the compact companion star has a mass > 3 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;then it is a black hole.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;We can’t usually resolve the details of the orbit directly in images, but we can<br>measure orbital speeds and periods well enough to work out what the orbit is by&nbsp;using the Doppler effect.</p>
