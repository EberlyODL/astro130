<p>The reading for this lesson is in the book, Ch. 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;“Black Holes in our backyard”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we “see” a black hole in the sky?</p>

<p>The black hole would have to be VERY CLOSE to us. &nbsp;At a distance of 10 Schwarzschild radii (hereafter R<sub>sch</sub>), the black hole would appear as in the right panel of the figure; at a distance of 1000 R<sub>sch</sub> it would appear as in the left panel of the figure.</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Can we maybe detect black holes with gravitational lensing effects?</a>
<p>Gravitational lensing effects applied to stellar-mass objects (masses up to a few hundred masses of the Sun)&nbsp;are called microlensing events. &nbsp;Here is a depiction of microlensing of a black hole of a few solar masses.</p></li></ol></div>

<p>Detections are possible with this method, but the mass of the lensing object is difficult to estimate from such observations. (Stellar-mass black holes are the ones formed by the gravitational collapse of dead stars that are too massive to become neutron stars or white dwarfs. &nbsp;They are different from the supermassive black holes found in centers of galaxies.)</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Based on what you know about black holes, how would you search for one?</a>
<p>As you saw in the first section of Ch. 3, this is not an easy question to answer and took many iterations of scientific thought to get to the two methods.</p>
<p><span class="red-text">1) search for binary star systems with X-ray emission</span>. If one of the stars in the binary system is a black hole and the stars were close enough together, material from the visible star could fall onto the black hole, creating an X-ray source. Difficulty with this technique is that X-rays are absorbed strongly by the Earth’s atmosphere (and by interstellar gas and dust), so we must make the observations from space (X-ray space telescopes).</p>
<p><span class="red-text">2) Orbital motion of companion stars</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;use Newton’s laws to work out the&nbsp;mass of an unseen companion. &nbsp;If the compact companion star has a mass > 3 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;then it is most likely a black hole. (3 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;is the mass limit on neutron degeneracy pressure, just like the electron degeneracy mass limit for white dwarfs is 1.4 M<sub>sun</sub>). When we observe X-ray radiation coming from&nbsp;binary star systems, they tend to flicker rapidly on time scales of milliseconds. &nbsp;This is an indication that the radiation must come from a compact region with the dimensions of a black hole or a neutron star.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is an X-ray binary? Why are these objects important?</a>
<p>X-ray binaries are a class of binary stars that are luminous in X-ray wavelengths. &nbsp;X-rays are produced by matter falling from one star (usually a regular star*) to the other compact star, which is typically a white dwarf, a neutron star of a black hole. &nbsp;Detecting X-rays from these binary systems is the best technique for finding black holes.</p>
<p>*[“Regular&nbsp;star” is a star supported by nuclear fusion in its core]. High-energy light should be emitted by material falling onto black holes; this, in fact, should be one of the principal signatures of a black hole because it is hard for ordinary astronomical objects to emit X rays.</p></li></ol></div>
<p>A few more terms with “X-ray”&nbsp;in them:</p>
<p>A system is called an&nbsp;X-ray pulsar&nbsp;if the source of the X-rays is from a&nbsp;spinning neutron star, i.e.&nbsp;pulsar. [p.56]</p>
<p>When enough matter accumulates on the surface of a neutron star it can start nuclear fusion for a short amount of time producing X-rays. &nbsp;We call these events&nbsp;X-ray bursts.</p>
<h3>Example of an Evolutionary Path from a Binary to an X-Ray Binary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We start with a system of two stars in a binary. The most massive star is the quickest to evolve, burn its Hydrogen supply, and become a red giant. It then transfers mass to the other star and eventually blows up as a supernova. For a period of time the system will consist of a compact object (neutron star or a black hole) and a massive companion with a strong mass outflow (stellar wind).</p>
