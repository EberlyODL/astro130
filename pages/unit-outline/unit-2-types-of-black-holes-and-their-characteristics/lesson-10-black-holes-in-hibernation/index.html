<p><strong>How much mass does it take to power a quasar by accretion? Where does the gas come from?</strong></p>
<p>It takes about 1 M<sub>sun</sub> per year (p180). This is quite a bit of gas and it is very unlikely that a supermassive black hole can maintain such inflow for a long time. Therefore, the AGN phase for galaxies actually last for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Spiral and irregular galaxies have a large fraction of interstellar medium (which is gas) when compared to stars. This gas is gravitationally bound to its galaxy and orbits within the galaxy itself. The only way for the interstellar gas to reach the central part of a galaxy is for it to be disturbed.&nbsp; <em><u>Galaxy collisions and encounters with other galaxies can disrupt the orbits of gas and send it funneling toward the central supermassive black hole</u></em>. It is also possible through galaxy collisions for the larger galaxy to swallow the intergalactic gas, or the gas from the smaller galaxy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Galaxy interactions and collisions are frequent, but they were significantly more common in the past when the universe was smaller. This is why we observe quasars only in the distant past when the universe was about 2 billion years old (“era of quasars” - when quasars were more common).</p>
<p>Most galaxies today, when the age of the universe is about 13.7 billion years, don’t have active nuclei, but are in “hibernation” (as your book calls it).&nbsp; Some of the galaxies that we see today may have undergone a ‘quasar phase’ in their distant past.</p>

<p><strong>Sagittarius A – it is in the constellation of Sagittarius.&nbsp; It emits radiation in flares of radio, infrared and X-ray wavelengths.&nbsp; Early on it was considered to most likely be a black hole since the size of Sagittarius A is very compact, less than the size of Earth’s orbit, its spectrum resembles one of gas swirling into a black hole, and it doesn’t move compared to other stars in the galaxy. Later on astronomers discovered that stars near this Milky Way nucleus are young and move very fast as if they are orbiting a very massive object.</strong></p></li></ol></div>

<p><strong>How did astronomers measure the mass of Milky Way’s supermassive black hole?</strong></p>
<p>Two groups, Genzel at Max Planck Institute, Germany vs. Ghez group at UCLA, competed and observed the motions of stars near the center of the galaxy and were able to determine that the mass of the central black hole of the Milky Way galaxy is about 3x10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>. They used the orbits of about 12 stars near the center to estimate the semimajor axis and the period of orbit for each of the observed stars. From Newton’s version of Kepler’s law, it was then possible to calculate the mass in the center (we did this in homework #2).</p>

<p><strong>What evidence is there for a black hole in the center of NGC 4258?</strong></p>
<p>NGC 4258 has a disk around the black hole and a weak jet, but this is not enough evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>We detect spectra of <em><u>water molecules</u></em> in the gas clouds that are orbiting near the nucleus.&nbsp; The estimated mass is from MASERs and it is 36 million M<sub>sun</sub>.</p>
