<p>(p.197)&nbsp;<em>Black holes swallow gas at significantly lower rates than predicted</em>. Here is a schematic drawing of how energy is converted as gas falls into the black hole.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this chain of events, the process becomes inefficient, and the black hole doesn’t actually swallow as much gas as it should. We do not yet understand why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can stars be destroyed by black holes?</p>
<p>Stars galaxies don’t have fixed orbits like the planets in the solar system.&nbsp; Their orbits change because they are affected by gravity of other stars around them.&nbsp; Since the orbits change, these stars can actually get shredded by the central supermassive black holes. You can see a theoretical simulation of this process in the figure on page 200.</p>
<p>We also observe these effects in real (astronomy) life. Bellow is an image of Sagittarius A, Miliky Way’s supermassive black hole, flaring up in X-rays.&nbsp; The image is taken in X-rays and the red corresponds to low energy, green medium&nbsp;and blue to high energy X-rays.&nbsp; This particular event was a <strong>megaflare</strong> – it made the source look 400 times brighter than usual.&nbsp; It occurred on 14<sup>th</sup> September, 2013.&nbsp; There was another big flare in October 2014 which was 200 times brighter than usual.</p>

<p><strong>What caused the flares?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely it was a star that has been tidally disrupted and its gas was stretched and swallowed by the black hole the next time that it approached the black hole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure shows this gas, marked as G2 flying past the central part of the galaxy and then what it looks like when the flare occurs.</p>
<p>It is predicted that every few thousand years one star could be destroyed in such a way by the central massive black hole in a quiescent galaxy like our own.</p>
