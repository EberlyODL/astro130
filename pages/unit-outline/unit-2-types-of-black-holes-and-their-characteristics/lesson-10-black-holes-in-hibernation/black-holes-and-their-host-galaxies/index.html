<p>Supermassive black hole masses are strongly correlated with the properties of their host galaxies. <strong><em>The more massive the SMBH, the more massive the galaxy, and larger the galaxy bulge.</em></strong></p>
<p>Observations tell us that the mass of the SMBH is typically 1,000 times smaller than the mass of the bulge, and the size of SMBH is 10<sup>8</sup> times smaller than the mass of the bulge!</p>

<p>Next are examples of galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and how they compare to the size of their bulges.</p>

<p>How can SMBHs whose mass is insignificantly low when compared to the rest of the galaxy, have such a strong correlation with their host galaxies?</p>
<p>The answer may be understood in terms of gravitational binding energy: E=GM<sup>2</sup>/R</p>
<p>The binding energy of SMBH is about 100 times bigger than the binding energy of the bulge!</p>
<p>During the formation and growth of their host galaxies, SMBHs can exert considerable amount of “feedback”.&nbsp; What this means is that any energy that is produced in the vicinity of the black hole, for example outflows in the form of jets, or high energy radiation from an accretion disk, can stop or regulate star&nbsp;formation in the other parts of the galaxy.&nbsp; This also suggest that SMBHs co-evolved with their galaxy hosts rather than forming before the galaxy itself.</p>
