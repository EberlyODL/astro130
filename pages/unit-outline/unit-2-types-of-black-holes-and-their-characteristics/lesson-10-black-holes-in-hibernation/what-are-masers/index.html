<p>Read p187. Briefly - when intense radiation induces molecules to emit photons at a particular wavelength.</p>
<p>An excited atom or molecule will drop back to a lower energy state on its own after an uncertain amount of time.&nbsp; However, if a photon with exactly the same wavelength as the required energy for de-excitation passes by, it can stimulate the molecule (or atom) to drop down to the lower energy state and emit a photon immediately. This emission is then added to the photon that was passing by, and the radiation is now amplified. When this happens to a large number of molecules, we call it MASERs – amplified or stimulated emission.&nbsp; In fact, their full name is quite descriptive = Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission.&nbsp; MASERs allow us to detect individual gas clouds in galaxies (your book shows NGC 2458 as an example).</p>

<p><strong>What are some ways in which we can infer a presence of a black hole in regular galaxies</strong> (non-AGN)?</p>
<p>1) <em><u>Velocities of stars increase closer to central massive black hole</u></em>. If there were no black hole in the center of a galaxy, the velocities would level off close to the center.&nbsp; In the presence of a black hole, stars close to the nucleus will move much faster than the stars that are not influenced by the black hole.</p>
<p>There is a sphere of influence which tells us how close a star can get to the black hole to be dominated by gravity of the black hole and NOT by gravity of the stars in outer orbits. The radius of this sphere is:</p>
<p><lrn-math>{r}_{\text{sphere of influence}}\infty{\frac{M_{bh}}{V^{2}_{star}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>The size of the sphere of influence is usually about few millions times larger than the event horizon of the black hole.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) <em><u>The number of stars close to the central supermassive black hole increases</u></em>.&nbsp; If there were no black hole, the concentration of stars close to the center wouldn’t be as high. We see this as sharp enhancement in brightness of starlight at the very center of a black hole.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While these two methods are a good way to indicate the presence of a black hole in the center of a galaxy, they are not a guarantee.&nbsp; For example, if the black hole had weak accretion, its signature would be indistinguishable from a larger concentration of stars in the center.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3) <em><u>The “zigzag” signature of velocity of gas</u></em> close to the galaxy center also indicates the presence of a black hole.&nbsp; See figure on page 196.</p>

<p><strong>What is the mass of M87’s (in Virgo Cluster) central supermassive black hole?&nbsp; Is this unusual?</strong></p>
<p>The mass of M87 was found to be 2-3 billion M<sub>sun</sub>. This is probably one of the most massive black holes that we know of. To give you perspective, Milky Way’s central black hole is about 3 million M<sub>sun</sub>, Andromeda’s is 140 million M<sub>sun</sub>., M84’s is 300 million M<sub>sun</sub>.</p>

<p>Does the black hole influence the property of its host galaxy in any way?</p>
<p>Yes! The mass of the central massive black holes is related to the mass of its host galaxy.&nbsp; The more massive the galaxy, the more massive the black hole in the center (see figure on p197).&nbsp; Although we do not yet understand the details of why this is so, this relationship points toward a possible connection between the growth of the supermassive black holes and the formation and evolution of galaxies.&nbsp;</p>
