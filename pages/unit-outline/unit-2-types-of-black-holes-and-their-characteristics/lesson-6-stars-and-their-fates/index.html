<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">How do low- and high-mass stars die?</a>
<p>Stars less massive than 8 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;are considered low-mass stars and will all&nbsp;end their life as white dwarfs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stars more massive than 8 M<sub>sun</sub>&nbsp;will explode as supernovae leaving behind &nbsp;either a neutron star (if the mass of the stellar remnant is < 3 M<sub>sun</sub>) or a black hole (if the mass of the stellar remnant is > 3M<sub>sun</sub>).</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What type of object will the Sun become at the end of its life?</a>
<p>A white dwarf star.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">How long does a star like the Sun live? How does this compare to lifetime of a 20 M<sub>sun</sub> star?</a>
<p>Sun: total of 10 billion years. 20 M<sub>sun</sub> star is 1000 times more luminous than the Sun and it will live only a few million years.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is a typical size of a white dwarf? What is a typical size of a neutron star?</a>
<p>WDs are the size of Earth, neutron stars 10-20 km in diameter (about the size of a small city on Earth).</p>

<p>Higher-mass white dwarfs are smaller! The more massive WD is smaller because it has stronger gravity and it can be&nbsp;compressed more.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What supports a white dwarf from collapsing?</a>
<p>Electron degeneracy pressure. Electrons are so tightly packed together that they move (jiggle) very fast and they start exerting a pressure of their own.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">How many times stronger is gravitational field of a white dwarf or a neutron star compared to Earth’s?</a>
<p>WD has a million times stronger gravitational field when compared to Earth. A neutron star has 10<sup>12</sup> times stronger gravity.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is the Chandrasekhar’s limit and why does it exist?</a>
<p>Chandrasekhar’s limit is the maximum mass that a WD can have and this number is 1.4 M<sub>sun</sub>.</p>
<p>The more massive the white dwarf, the greater the degeneracy pressure and the faster the speeds of its electrons. The more fermions (protons, neutrons and electrons) are compressed, the faster they move. When the mass of a WD is close to&nbsp;1.4 M<sub>sun</sub>, the speeds of the electrons approach the speed of light, so if the WD were more massive, its electrons would move faster than the speed of light, which is not possible.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What would happen to a white dwarf that exceeds the 1.4 M<sub>sun</sub> limiting mass? </a>
<p>The electron degeneracy would break and the star would gravitationally collapse within 1 second. It would explode as a supernova and there would be no remnant left after the supernova explosion.</p></li></ol></div>
