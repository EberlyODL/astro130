<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">“Heavier atomic nuclei contain a larger number of protons and therefore repel each other electrically with more force.” &nbsp;What does this tell us about nuclear&nbsp;fusion reactions in cores of stars?</a>
<p>In order for the nuclei to overcome this repulsion and fuse together to form the next element, a higher temperature is needed. The core of a star gets hotter and hotter as the star goes through fusing chemical elements increasing in atomic weight.</p>
<p>Since the temperature always increases in the core, so do the rates of nuclear fusion reactions. Each stage of star’s evolution is shorter than the previous one: the temperature always increases in the core, the nuclear reactions are faster and they support the star for shorter periods of time. For example a 20 M<sub>sun</sub> star burns:</p>
<p>H in 10 million yrs</p>
<p>He in 1 million yrs</p>
<p>O in 1 year</p>
<p>Si in 1 week</p>
<p>Fe in 1 day!</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">Which particles are considered to be subatomic?</a>

<p>When a star has burnt all the Si into Fe in its core, it will collapse since Fe cannot be fused into higher elements without absorbing energy. Fe nuclei are too tightly bound and energy is required (opposite of produced as in all previous fusion reactions we saw in stars)&nbsp;to convert Fe&nbsp;into heavier elements.</p>
<p>Star with layers of elements fusing in individual shells:</p>
<p><lrn-math>{\text{H}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{He}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{C}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{O}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{Ne}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{Mg}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{Si}}\ {\rightarrow}\ {\text{Fe}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><img src="assets/iron_core.jpg" width="277" height="215" alt=""></p>
<p>Right before the supernova explosion, the core consists of Fe and it is supported by electron degeneracy pressure. &nbsp;However, this does not last long. Gravity pushes electrons so close to protons that they combine into neutrons through the following reaction:</p>
<p><lrn-math>{{\text{e}}^{-}}+{{\text{p}}^{+}}\rightarrow{{0}^{+}}\</lrn-math> neutrinos</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point gravity wins and the core collapses into a ball of neutrons just a few km across. Many neutrinos are released from the core of the star through this reaction. &nbsp;The collapse of the core pauses because now the neutrons provide their own degeneracy pressure. &nbsp;However, this halt due to neutron degeneracy pressure is very brief. &nbsp;Gravitational collapse of the core releases so much energy that it drives the outer layers of the star away in an explosion, i.e. supernova.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vast amount of neutrinos released produces a shock wave that drives the other layers of the star out into space. Note that in a case of a very massive star, there will be enough mass (i.e. gravity) for the star to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure. In that case, the core will continue to collapse and will become a black hole.</p></li></ol></div>
<p><strong>If a star is able to overcome neutron degeneracy pressure, then it will become a black hole.</strong></p>
<p>Just like there was a limit to the maximum mass of white dwarfs, there is a limit for the maximum mass of a neutron star. &nbsp;This limit is about 3 M<sub>sun</sub>. &nbsp;If the remaining object is less massive than 3 M<sub>sun</sub>, it is a neutron star. &nbsp;If the core of the star is more massive than 3 M<sub>sun</sub>, then the core is massive enough to overcome neutron degeneracy and it will completely collapse and become a black hole.</p>
