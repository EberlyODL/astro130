<p>Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish in 1968.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What observations make us think that neutron stars are losing energy?</a>
<p>Their spin is slowing down.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">How do we know what the interior of a neutron star is made of? What is the structure of a neutron star like?</a>
<p>We observe sudden glitches, increases in spin rate, which are only possible if the crust of the neutron star is solid.</p>

<p>A liquid core has no viscosity (resembles a superfluid) and&nbsp;is&nbsp;made of free neutrons. On top of it is a solid crust which is made mostly of iron with other neutron-rich nuclei below it.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">How does a neutron star lose energy?</a>
<p>Magnetic field lines carry particles (energy) away along the magnetic field axis.</p>
<p>Other important properties of neutron stars (beyond mass and size): Rotation – as the parent star collapses, the neutron core spins very rapidly, conserving angular momentum (when something shrinks, it must spin faster). Typical periods are fractions of a second. Magnetic field – again as a result of the collapse, the neutron star’s magnetic field becomes enormously strong.</p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">What is in the center of the Crab nebula? </a>
