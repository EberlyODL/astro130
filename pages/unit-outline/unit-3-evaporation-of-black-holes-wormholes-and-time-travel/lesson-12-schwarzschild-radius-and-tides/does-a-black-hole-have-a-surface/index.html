<p>The “surface” of a black hole is the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. This <em><u>spherical surface</u></em> is known as the <strong><em>event horizon.</em></strong>&nbsp; The radius of the event horizon is the <strong><em>Schwarzschild radius.</em></strong></p>
<p>Nothing within the event horizon can escape the black hole. When an object is far away from a black hole, the gravity that it feels is no different from a star of a similar total “mass”.&nbsp; It is only when you get close that you could get “sucked in”.</p>
<p><em><u>The gravitational effects (tidal forces) of a black hole are unnoticeable outside of a few Schwarzschild radii</u></em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Calculate the event horizon of the supermassive black hole in the center of our Galaxy?&nbsp; The mass of the SMBH is 3 million masses of the Sun (that is 3x10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>sun</sub>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are going to use the version of the Schwarzschild radius equation that is expressed in masses of the Sun (we will use this equation on the exam and the homework):</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}\ {\approx<br>&nbsp; }\ {\text{3 km}}({{\frac{M_{BH}}{m_{sun}})=}}\ {\text{3 km}}({\frac{3\ {\bullet}\ 10^6M_{sun}}{M_{sun}})}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}=9\ {\bullet}\ 10^6 \ {\text{km}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>Notice that the Schwarzschild radius (or the event horizon) of the SMBH in the center of our Galaxy is significantly smaller than the Solar system (about 5 times smaller).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Calculate the event horizon of a stellar-mass black hole with the mass of 3 M<sub>sun</sub>.</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}\ {\approx<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}\ {\text{3 km}}({{\frac{M_{BH}}{m_{sun}})=}}\ {\text{3 km}}({\frac{3M_{sun}}{M_{sun}})}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}=9\&nbsp;{\text{km}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>Whoa, that is pretty close to the black hole!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What is the difference between a black hole’s event horizon and its Schwarzschild radius?&nbsp; And its actual radius?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>A:&nbsp;<em>Schwarzschild radius</em> is the radius at which the escape speed from the black hole equals the speed of light.&nbsp; <em>Event horizon</em> is the spherical surface (a black hole should be spherical just like the star from which it was formed) whose radius is the Schwarzschild radius.&nbsp; It is not a real surface in a sense that we can touch and feel it, but more of a zone within which nothing can escape the black hole.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The actual black hole must be much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, but we do not know its true size.&nbsp; The black hole itself is usually called the <strong><em>singularity</em></strong>. So far, we thought of the size of the singularity to be close to zero.&nbsp; It is a spherical region at the center of the event horizon and its size is though to be 10<sup>-35</sup> m (notice that this is significantly smaller than the size of a proton; proton size is ~10<sup>-16</sup>m). <em>This is the place where the gravitational tidal field becomes infinity</em>.&nbsp;</p>
