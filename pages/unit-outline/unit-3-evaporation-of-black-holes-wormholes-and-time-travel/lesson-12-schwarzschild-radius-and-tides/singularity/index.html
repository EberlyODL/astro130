<p>Singularity is the actual black hole whose size is thought to be almost zero.&nbsp; Singularity is spherical and it is the place where the tidal forces become infinite. Since it is so small and yet gravity is so strong, we need quantum gravity to understand it better.&nbsp; To date, the black hole singularity is poorly understood.</p>
<p>A formula is called <strong>singular</strong> if, when one puts the numbers into it in a calculation, the result is infinity, or is not well defined. The particular combination of numbers is called the <strong>singularity</strong>. Singularities often arise in the formulas of physics and astronomy. They usually indicate either:</p>
<p>• invalid approximations -- not all of the necessary physical laws have been accounted for in the formula (no big deal), or</p>
<p>• that the singularity is not realizable (also no big deal), or</p>
<p>• that a mathematical error was made in obtaining the formula (just plain wrong).</p>

<p>Example of a classical physics law with a singularity: Newton’s law of gravitation.</p>

<p>Where <em>r</em> is the distance between the centers of the two spherical masses. A spherical mass exerts a force as if its mass is concentrated at its center. Clearly, if <em>r</em> were zero, the force would be infinite!</p>
<p>Karl Schwarzschild’s solution to the Einstein field equation was demonstrated to be correct - the singularity is not the result of a math error. Thus most physicists and astronomers assumed that the singularity would not be physically realizable (just like the singularity in Newton’s law of gravitation) or that accounting for other physical effects would remove it.</p>
<p>Einstein (1939) eventually tried to prove this in a general relativistic calculation of stable (non-collapsing or exploding) stars of size equal to the Schwarzschild circumference. He found that this would require <strong>infinite gas pressure</strong>, or <strong>particle speed greater than the speed of light</strong>, both of which are impossible. He concluded (<strong>incorrectly</strong>) that this meant the singularity could not exist in nature. However, at the time we didn’t know that there is something stronger than gas pressure: <strong>degeneracy pressure</strong>! So the singularity is real!</p>
