<p>Recall that every massive object has an escape velocity:</p>
<p><lrn-math>v_{esc}={\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">Where </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">M</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> and </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;">r</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6;"> are the mass and the radius of an object respectively. The escape velocity from any body depends on its mass, and on the starting distance. The escape velocity is larger for larger masses and smaller distances.</span></p>
<p>The radius at which the escape speed from the black hole equals the speed of light is called the <strong>Schwarzschild radius:</strong></p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}={\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{c^2}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><em>G</em> = Newton’s gravitational constant (~6.67x10<sup>-11</sup>m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>)</p>
<p><em>c</em> = speed of light (~300,000,000 m/s)</p>
<p><em>M</em> = Mass of the object</p>
<p></p>
<p>This equation can also be expressed in units of masses of the Sun and it is then easer to use:</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{sch}={\text{3 km}}{\times}{\sqrt{\frac{M}{m_{sun}}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>Earth’s Schwarzschild radius is about a centimeter; the Sun’s is about 3 km.</p>
<div class="question"><p>What would happen to Earth’s orbit if our Sun suddenly became a black hole?</p>
<ol><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">A. Earth would be sucked into the center of the black hole.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">B. Earth would be flung off into outer space.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">C. Earth would gradually drift away from the black hole.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">D. Earth’s orbit would not change.</a>
<p><strong>Yes. Force of gravity from a black hole is the same as from any other object with the same mass at the same distance.&nbsp; The orbit of the Earth would not change if the Sun was replaced with a black hole with the same mass as the Sun.&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol></div>
