<p>We have often said that their gravity around neutron stars and black holes is very strong, but why are the gravitational effects so strong close to the black hole when the force of gravity depends on 1/(distance)<sup>2</sup> just like for any other massive object? What stretches matter as it encounters a black hole are actually the enormously strong tidal forces.
</p>
<p><strong>What is a tidal force?</strong>&nbsp; Tidal force is a difference in gravitational force from one end of the object to the other end.&nbsp; The strength of tides on Earth’s oceans depends on the position between the Moon, Earth and the Sun.&nbsp; When all three are aligned in a straight line, tides are the strongest as shown in the Figure below.

</p>
<p>Earth pulls all things toward its center, and pulls harder on nearer things.
</p>
<p>To you, it seems as if you are stretched in the direction of the earth’s center, and squeezed in the other direction (see figure below).

</p>
<p><strong><em>Tides are usually defined as a difference in the gravitational pull on two opposite ends of an object</em></strong>.&nbsp; This is well illustrated here:

</p>
<p>If we just take into account the force of gravity, it will be different on the side of the Earth that is closer to the Moon, than the opposite side because the distance to the Moon (r<sub>1</sub> vs. r<sub>2</sub> in figure) is different for the two cases.&nbsp; This results in stretching the object.&nbsp; A good analogy is stretching a rubber band – in order to stretch one end, the other one must stretch.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can think of tides as an effect of gravitational force (as Newton did), or as the effect of a curvature, warping or stretching of space created by the presence of the gravitating mass.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have, so far, referred to effects on objects near black holes as effects of gravity, when in fact it is the tidal forces that cause objects to stretch and be torn apart as something approaches a black hole.
</p>
<ul><li>Tidal forces around <strong>low-mass</strong> black holes rip objects apart <strong><em><u>before</u></em></strong> entering the event horizon.</li><li>Tidal forces around <strong>high-mass</strong> black holes rip objects apart <strong><em><u>after</u></em></strong> entering the event horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this the case?&nbsp; The <strong><em>tidal force </em></strong>pulling an object apart is:
</p>
<p><lrn-math>{\Delta}{F}\ {\approx}\ {\frac{GMm}{r^{3}}}l\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p>Where <em>M </em>is the mass of a black hole, <em>m</em> is the object’s mass, <em>l</em> is the object’s height, and <em>r</em> is the object’s distance from the black hole.
</p>
<p>You will be torn when the tidal force reaches a critical value F<sub>rip</sub>. What is that value?&nbsp; Fortunately, it is not easy to find what this ripping force would be for humans, so we will use 16 tons = 1.4x10<sup>5 </sup>N (32,000 lb), according to Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}=({{\frac{GMml}{F_{rip}})}}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p>when we plug in 1.4x10<sup>5 </sup>N, a typical weight and height of a human we get an expression for a ripping radius of a black hole for a human weighing kg in terms of the mass of the black hole.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>\(r_{rip}\ {\approx
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}\ {\text{490 km}}({{\frac{M_{BH}}{m_{sun}})}}^{1/3}\)
</p>
<p>The M/M<sub>sun</sub> is just a way of expressing the mass of the black hole in masses of the Sun.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What is the radius at which you would be ripped apart by a 3x10<sup>6</sup> M<sub>sun</sub> black hole at the center of our Galaxy?
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ =\ {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ ({{\frac{3\ {\bullet\ 10^6M_{sun}}}{M_{sun}})}}^{1/3}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ =\ {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ (3\ {\bullet}\ 10^6)^{1/3}= {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ &nbsp;{\text{144.225}}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ =\ {\text{70,670 km}}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What is the radius at which you would be ripped apart by a 3 M<sub>sun</sub> black hole discovered as an X-ray binary?
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ =\ {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ ({{\frac{3M_{sun}}{M_{sun}})}}^{1/3}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ =\ {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ (3)^{1/3}= {\text{490 km}}\ {\times}\ {\text{1.44225}}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p><lrn-math>r_{rip}\ {\approx}\ {\text{707 km}}\</lrn-math>
</p>
<p>In the part of the lesson about the Schwarzschild radius we calculated that the Schwarzschild radius for a SMBH like the one in the center of Milky Way would be about<em> 9x10<sup>6</sup></em> km, while the radius at which you would be ripped apart is about <em>70,670</em> km. This means that one would be ripped apart <strong>after</strong> entering the event horizon for a massive black hole.
</p>
<p>For a low-mass black hole of <em>3</em> M<sub>sun</sub> we calculated the Schwarzschild radius was about <em>9</em> km, while the ripping radius is way <strong>beyond</strong> the event horizon, at about <em>707</em> km from the black hole.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, matter encountering a black hole will experience enormous tidal forces that will both heat it enough to radiate, and tear it apart.
</p>
<p>•&nbsp; <strong><em>For a low-mass black hole, you will be ripped apart before entering the event horizon.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>•&nbsp; For a high-mass black hole, you will be ripped apart after entering the event horizon.</em></strong> (p. 200)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would be ripped apart exactly at the Schwarzschild radius when the mass of a black hole is about 2,000 M<sub>sun</sub>.&nbsp; For lower mass black holes <em>r<sub>rip </sub>> r<sub>sch</sub></em> and one is torn before reaching the event horizon.&nbsp; If you want to see what it is like inside an even horizon, choose a black hole with mass much larger than 2,000 M<sub>sun</sub>. However, this delays your tidal disruption by only a small amount.
