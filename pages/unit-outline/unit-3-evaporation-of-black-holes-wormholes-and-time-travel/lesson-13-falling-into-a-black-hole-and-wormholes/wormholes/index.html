<p><strong><em>Wormholes</em></strong> are mathematical solutions to the Einstein field equation that involve two singularities.&nbsp; A wormhole can be thought of as a special combination of two black holes where the interiors of the two black holes are connected.</p>
<p>A black hole on one side, a <strong>white hole </strong>on the other side.&nbsp; Nothing can enter a white hole from the outside, but matter and light can escape from it.</p>
<p>According to our present (incomplete) understanding of quantum gravity, two such singularities may “unwarp” each other to produce a “tube” of continuous paths through hyperspace between the two black holes.</p>

<p>This tube through hyperspace is the wormhole. It wouldn’t look like a tube in physical space, though; each mouth would still look spherical from the outside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The down side: what happens if you try to enter the wormhole to employ the shortcut?</p>
<p>You are accelerated to relativistic speeds on your way through. As a result, your energy (and mass) increase dramatically, in the rest frame of the wormhole.</p>
<p>Your mass eventually becomes large enough, halfway through the wormhole, that your own gravity warps spacetime, collapsing the wormhole onto you.</p>
<p>As your gravity “pinches off” the wormhole, singularities form again - but this time, they’re of the black hole type. Your energy is added to the black holes, and the wormhole is destroyed (and you are, too).</p>
<p></p>
<p>How could we prevent the collapse of the wormhole under your gravitational influence, so you could make it through unscathed?</p>
<p>By putting exotic matter into it. Exotic matter has negative energy density and it would be “anti-gravity”: it would warp spacetime in senses opposite to the way normal matter warps it.&nbsp; In particular, adding exotic matter to a wormhole would tend to expand the diameter of its effective “hyperspace tunnel.”</p>
