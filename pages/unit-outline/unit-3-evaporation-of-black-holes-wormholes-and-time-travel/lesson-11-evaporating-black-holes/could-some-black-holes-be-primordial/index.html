<p>Here are the four possible types of black holes listed by increasing mass:</p>
<p>1) <strong><span class="deep-orange-text">Mini-black holes</span></strong> (masses significantly less than 1 M<sub>sun</sub>)</p>
<p>2) <span class="purple-text"><strong>Stellar-mass black holes</strong></span> (masses of 3 – hundreds of M<sub>sun</sub>)</p>
<p>3) <span class="teal-text"><strong>Intermediate-mass black holes</strong></span> (masses of hundreds to tens of thousands of M<sub>sun</sub>)</p>
<p>4) <strong>Supermassive black holes</strong> (masses of millions to tens of billion M<sub>sun</sub>)</p>
<p>We have substantial observational evidence for the existence of the <em>stellar-mass</em> black holes within our own galaxy and the <em>supermassive</em> black holes in centers of many other galaxies. The existence of other two types lacks substantial evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one mechanism of forming black holes that we are certain of is the formation of stellar-mass black holes.&nbsp; This process involves massive stars that undergo supernova explosions - the core of the star overcomes neutron degeneracy pressure and forms a black hole. &nbsp;We explored the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the previous unit, and there were multiple scenarios that described this process.&nbsp; Possible progenitors of SMBHs in centers of galaxies are black holes that formed from (i) supermassive primordial stars, (ii) collapse of a large gas cloud, (iii) collapse of a dense star cluster, or (iv) primordial black holes that formed very early on in the history of the universe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="teal-text">Intermediate-mass</span></strong> black holes are though to exist, but we have not discovered them yet.&nbsp; There are some observations that imply their presence in low-mass galaxies or a globular cluster or two, but there is not yet enough evidence that these are truly intermediate-mass black holes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are black holes called “<span class="deep-orange-text"><strong>miniholes</strong></span>” which are significantly less massive than a star and are the size of a proton.&nbsp; These miniholes would have to have been formed up to 1 second after the Big Bang – so we call them <strong><em>primordial</em></strong>.&nbsp; If they formed later than 1 sec after the Big Bang, they would interfere with the production of chemical elements in the universe, which would be inconsistent with the measured abundance of elements in the universe.&nbsp; We have no proof that these exist, yet.</p>
<p>Miniholes are interesting because they are so small and yet have strong gravity that they are the one place where we can examine how gravity links to other forces.&nbsp; Gravity cannot describe effects at sizes of atoms or molecules, while quantum mechanics cannot describe effects on large sizes/masses like planets or stars.&nbsp; This means that our overall picture of the universe is split between the microscopic and the macroscopic worlds where each is governed by different laws. &nbsp;This is why physicists have been searching for a theory that would unify all the physical laws. We call this theory&nbsp;quantum gravity.&nbsp; We have not yet discovered neither the miniholes, nor quantum gravity.</p>
<p>A first glimpse into unifying gravity and quantum mechanics was provided by Stephen Hawking who discovered a way for black holes to evaporate, a process also called “Hawking radiation”.</p>
