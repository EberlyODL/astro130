<p><strong><em>When two BHs collide and coalesce, the area of the final hole’s horizon must always be larger than the sum of the areas of the original hole. </em></strong></p>
<p>When a BH accretes matter, or collides with another BH, or the BH does anything else, its absolute horizon changes shape: <em>the area of the horizon will almost always increase and can never decrease!</em></p>
<p>Stephen Hawking calculated that up to 50% of the mass of the two original holes could be converted to gravitational-wave energy. &nbsp;Meaning that the final mass can be 50% less!&nbsp; This implies that the final hole must have a smaller mass (or smaller energy).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>When two BHs collide the resulting black hole has a mass that is less than the sum of the two black holes that collided</strong>.</p>
<p>M<sub>BH1</sub> + M<sub>BH2</sub> > M<sub>merged</sub></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ‘missing’ mass is emitted in the form of gravitational waves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why should this seem strange?</p>
<p>The horizon-area theorem is simple (and intuitively obvious), but represents a puzzle at a deeper level when one reflects on the <strong>heat</strong> and <strong>disorder</strong> in the matter that forms or falls into a black hole.</p>
<p>– Before: the matter is hot, and there are lots of particles sharing the heat among themselves in the form of their random motions. A complete description of the system would thus have different entries for position and velocity for each particle, i.e. a vast number of <em>numbers</em> required.</p>
<p>– After: the system can be completely described by only three numbers, its mass, spin and charge. It’s orderly!</p>
<p>The problem is, in all other natural processes <strong>matter is never seen to go from a disorderly state to an orderly one all by itself. </strong>This is in fact a law of thermodynamics – the total entropy of a closed system never decreases.</p>
<p>(Entropy = the logarithm of the number of ways all of the atoms and molecules in a system can be rearranged without changing the system’s overall appearance. A larger entropy means the system is more disorderly, or more “random.”)</p>
<p></p>
<p>So why does black-hole formation look so much as if it is a violation of the Second Law?</p>
<p>Black holes form from large collections of atoms and molecules, with extremely large numbers of equivalent rearrangements (large entropy).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a consequence of this realization Jacob Bekenstein (a Princeton graduate student in 1972) suggested that:<em> “If hole has entropy it also must have a temperature, which I find is proportional to the strength of gravity at the horizon.”</em></p>
<p>Hawking <em>et al.</em>’s (1972) response: But that would mean that the horizon is a <strong>black body</strong> at non-zero temperature that obeys the laws of thermodynamics. Any such body must radiate light - as the hot filament in a light bulb does, for instance. <em>Nothing can escape from a black hole horizon</em>; how can it radiate?</p>
<p>This discussion impelled Hawking to discover that black holes can lose energy and that they do glow.</p>
