<p>In the vast <strong><em>vacuum</em></strong> of space, on very small scales, there are particle - antiparticle pairs that come into existence and then&nbsp;evaporate very quickly.&nbsp; These are called <strong><em>virtual particles</em></strong>. For extremely short time intervals, enough energy can be borrowed from the vacuum (i.e. nothingness) to produce photons, or even massive particles. These virtual particles vanish very quickly depending on how much energy was borrowed from the vacuum.&nbsp; <span class="red-text"><strong><em>The more energy borrowed, the shorter the lifetime of the virtual particle pair</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p>For example, a virtual proton-antiproton pair can exist for only 10<sup>-24</sup> seconds, two green photons for about 10<sup>-16</sup> seconds before the pairs disappear back into the vacuum.&nbsp; They can be permanently created if some force pulls the pair apart.&nbsp; For example, a strong electric field can pull a positron and an electron apart.&nbsp; As long as the electric field supplies the energy that the virtual pair needs to “pay back” to the universe, the pair can be split up and the particles can become real. How does this process work in case of gravity and near black holes?</p>
<p>Black holes have strong gravitational tidal fields. &nbsp;Miniholes, size of an atom, have such strong tidal forces that they would perturb individual electrons and protons near them. If a virtual particle pair is created near a black hole, gravitational forces (tides) of the black hole can be strong enough to separate the two particles. It is possible for both particles to fall in, but it is also possible for one to fall in while the other escapes. The escaping particle is recorded by a distant observer as emission by the black hole horizon: <strong>black holes emit light</strong> (and other particles), though only in this weird way. The energy conservation “debt” involved in the vacuum fluctuation is paid by the black hole itself: <strong><em>the black hole’s mass decreases by the energy of the escaping particle</em></strong>&nbsp;divided by <em>c</em><sup>2</sup>. The emission of light (or any other particle) costs the black hole mass and energy.</p>
<h4>Why is it that the black hole can <em>consume</em> a particle, and wind up <em>decreasing</em> in mass and energy?</h4>
<p>Because in the strongly warped spacetime near the horizon, virtual particles made from vacuum fluctuations turn out to have <strong>negative energy density</strong>.<strong> (</strong>Energy density = energy per unit volume). These particles indeed have positive mass -- look at the one that escaped! -- but their mass is distributed very strangely over spacetime.&nbsp; Matter with negative energy density is generally called <strong><span class="#ffcc00-text">exotic matter</span>. </strong></p>
<p>Theoretical details of exotic matter, according to the present partial marriage of general relativity and quantum:</p>
<ul><li>Quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations <em><u>in flat spacetime</u></em> - far from any strong gravitational field - always have <em><u>zero net energy density</u></em>; they can never be exotic.</li><li>However, <em><u>in warped spacetime</u></em>, vacuum fluctuations are in general exotic: their <em><u>net energy density is negative</u></em>, according to a distant observer measuring the energy density by observation of the deflection of light by the ensemble of fluctuations. <em>The stronger the curvature, the more negative the energy density looks</em>.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>The conclusion is that <strong><em>black holes glow, lose mass, and eventually evaporate</em></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only particles that are as large or larger than the black hole can be created in virtual particle pairs (p.262). This means that only miniholes can emit electrons and positrons, while more massive (regular) black holes can emit photons where the wavelength of light must be larger than the size of the black hole’s event horizon. <em>According to Hawking (and Bekenstein), black holes glow at a particular temperature, proportional to the gravitational force just outside the black hole</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>More massive the black hole, cooler the temperature that it radiates</em>.&nbsp; Stellar-mass black holes would have temperature “only about a millionth of a degree above absolute zero” (p. 265). For these black holes and for supermassive black holes, the Hawking radiation is negligible. &nbsp;These black holes acquire more energy from their surroundings than they have the time to evaporate it.&nbsp; A stellar-mass black hole would evaporate in 10<sup>66</sup> years (a time much longer than even the current age of the universe).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miniholes, the size of a proton, would have a high temperature – about a billion degrees and would radiate in X-rays and Gamma rays. We would be able to see these, if one of them passed near our solar system. The trouble is that we are not certain that these miniholes ever formed in the universe.</p>
