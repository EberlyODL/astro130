<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>Black Holes in the Universe introduces students to the predicted properties of black holes and the astronomical evidence for their existence. Modern ideas about the nature of space, time, and gravity are also covered. The key topics discussed in the course include Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity, predicted properties of black holes, stars and their fates, how to detect a black hole, gamma-ray bursts, supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, active galaxies, black hole spin, gravitational waves, Hawking radiation, singularities, and black hole child universes. The course is intended to be an attractive choice for students who are interested in enriching and broadening their understanding of modern physical science.</p>

<h3>What You will Learn (Goals/Objectives)</h3>
<p>After taking this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol><li>describe the key ideas of special and general relativity and the evidence for each;</li><li>understand the difference between Newton’s and Einstein's theories of gravity;</li><li>explain what is a black hole, how one forms, and what happens near it and to objects falling into a black hole;</li><li>describe the difference between stellar mass and supermassive black holes, and how to detect each type;</li><li>explain what is an Active Galactic Nuclei and describe why black holes have jets</li><li>describe how black holes can loose energy through Hawking radiation and possibility of wormholes;</li></ol>
<p>We will spend the first few weeks discussing Einstein's ideas about space, time, and gravity since these ideas are absolutely critical for a proper understanding of black holes. Do not worry if black holes do not make an immediate appearance in the first couple weeks; they will be coming and will certainly be the main focus of the course.</p>

<h3>Meet Your Instructor</h3>
<p>My name is Dr. Ana Matković and I am a faculty member in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, and the official course instructor. &nbsp;As an astronomer, my expertise is in formation and evolution of galaxies and I have spent many years conducting research on these topics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am excited to welcome you to Astro 130 Web, a web version of the course titled "Black Holes in the Universe". &nbsp;I have developed the course content and it includes many images, movies, and questions for you to complete. &nbsp;I hope that you will become absorbed in the course over the semester, learn a great deal about black holes and that you will find the experience entertaining and rewarding.&nbsp;</p>
