<p>This course uses its own interface to organize and deliver the course content. The course will use ANGEL, like many of your other Penn State classes, for quizzes, exams, discussions, submission of the final paper, as well as e-mail communication and Course Announcements. We will refer to this unique interface as the Course Pages so it’s easier to distinguish between the Course Pages and ANGEL.</p>
<p>There is a convenient link located under the Lessons tab&nbsp;inside ANGEL that makes navigation between your Course Pages and ANGEL simple.</p>
<p>At the top of all of the Course Pages, you will notice the Main Menu runs from left to right, with tabs for Help and Resources.&nbsp;The menu bar, where you will find all of your course content, runs down the left hand side of the screen with tabs for Orientation, Units 1, 2, and 3, etc.&nbsp;</p>
