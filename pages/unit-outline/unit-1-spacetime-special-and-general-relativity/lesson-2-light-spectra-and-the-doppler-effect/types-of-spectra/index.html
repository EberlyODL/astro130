<p>When we shine light through a prism, it is broken into its component parts and we would see a spectrum.&nbsp; There are three different types of spectra (see Figure F-2-3):
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Continuous spectrum</strong> – produced by a hot and dense energy source. Examples are cores of stars, incandescent light bulbs, any opaque objects that have some temperature. In Astro 1 we referred to these objects as having <em>thermal radiation</em> which we represented by blackbody curves. From the figure, you can see that a continuous spectrum can be described as all colors of the rainbow, or a black body curve. &nbsp;

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Emission spectrum</strong>&nbsp;– produced by gases and transparent objects.&nbsp; Examples are gaseous nebula in the Milky Way galaxy, a neon light bulb, or any excited gas. &nbsp;Emission spectrum consists of bright color emission lines overlaid on a black background.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Absorption spectrum</strong>&nbsp;– is a combination of the previous two.&nbsp; We see an absorption spectrum when we are looking at a continuous source through some gas that is cooler than the continuous source.&nbsp; See Figure c bellow.&nbsp; A real life example is a spectrum of any star.&nbsp; Stars have hot dense cores that produce uninterrupted continuous spectra but their photospheres (upper layers) consist of a cooler gas that absorbs some of the light from the core. This absorbed light looks like dark lines on top of a continuous spectrum.
