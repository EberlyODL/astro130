<p>From gravitational time dilation, we know that time slows down in gravitational fields. This applies to atoms as well. The frequency of light that an atom emits in a strong gravitational field will be smaller – we will measure a longer wavelength. You can think of time being measured by the frequency (or wavelength) of light.</p>
<p>For example, a spectrum of a particular gas has a frequency of 300 trillion cycles per second when measured in a laboratory on Earth. When we look at the same gas on the surface of the Sun, we will see fewer than 300 trillion cycles per second because time runs slower on the Sun than it does on Earth. Lower frequency of light means longer wavelength, so the light from the Sun must be redshifted. This type of redshift is not in any way related to Doppler shift caused by the motion of objects. Instead, this type of redshift is caused by the fact that gravity slows time and it is called the&nbsp;<strong>gravitational redshift</strong>. Gravitational redshift has been measured on the Sun and on other stars, and the observations agree with the predictions of general relativity.</p>
<p><em>Time runs slowly in gravitational fields – <strong>gravitational redshift</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Close to a black hole, gravity is very strong, so time will slow down and light will experience the gravitational redshift. A photon escaping from the vicinity of a black hole will use up a lot of energy doing so. It can’t slow down because the speed of light must remain constant, so the only way for it to loose energy is by its wavelength getting longer and longer. Again, this is due to the gravity, not Doppler shift! It also means that for an object at the event horizon, time stands still (at least, as you measure it). You may have heard that a person falling into a black hole will freeze at the black hole and we would never see the person actually fall into the black hole. It is not correct that a person never falls into a black hole, they do. &nbsp;But&nbsp;the light from the person falling in gets so highly redshifted that s/he fades out of our view.</p>
