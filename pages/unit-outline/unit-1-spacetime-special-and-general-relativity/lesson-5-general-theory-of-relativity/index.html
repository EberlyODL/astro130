<p>Key Ideas of General Relativity</p>
<ul><li>Gravity arises from distortions of spacetime. The phenomenon of tides, usually explained as a differential force of gravity, can be explained&nbsp;as a property of curved space-time.</li><li>The effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another â€“ the equivalence principle.</li><li>Time runs slowly in gravitational fields.</li><li><em>Black holes</em> can exist in spacetime.
<ul><li>Spacetime becomes highly curved around a large mass compressed into a tiny space.</li><li>Around a black hole, spacetime becomes so curved that nothing can escape.</li></ul></li></ul>
