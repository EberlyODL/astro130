<p>Curved spacetime alters the paths of light rays, shifting the apparent positions of objects in an effect called <em>gravitational lensing</em>. Gravitational lensing can distort the images of objects.</p>
<p>Lensing can even make one object appear to be at two or more points in the sky.</p>

<p>When the deflecting body is massive enough, then the light deflection can work like a lens and produce images of the lensed object so that it:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;has multiple images (Einstein ring, Einstein cross)</li><li>&nbsp;has long arcs; and</li><li>&nbsp;is magnified in both size and brightness</li></ol>
<p>When four images of a lensed object appear in the sky we call this Einstein’s Cross. (see Figure). A ring of light from the background object appears in the sky is called Einstein’s Ring.</p>

<p>On the left, you see the Einstein Cross that consists of four images of the same supernova that exploded over 9 billion years ago. On the right hand figure, you can see how gravity of a foreground elliptical galaxy (center) bends light from an object almost directly behind it. This gravitational lensing configuration is called the Einstein’s Ring.</p>
<p>You can try to simulate gravitational lensing on your own, using a wine glass and a background light (see figure).</p>
