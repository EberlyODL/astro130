<p>This page contains a few examples of lensed objects in the universe.</p>
<p>The following&nbsp;image shows a background galaxy (blue galaxy in red circles) that is lensed by a galaxy cluster. The galaxy is twice as far as the foreground lens and shows up as&nbsp;five separate images!</p>

<p>Here is an image of another galaxy cluster acting like a lens and lensing numerous background galaxies. Notice the blue, red and yellow-ish arcs in this image.</p>

<p>This last image is simply amazing! The image is of a supernovae explosion which is lensed by a galaxy cluster. You can see four different images of the supernova which depict the supernova at different times.</p>
<p>“Four of them are arranged in a tight formation known as an Einstein Cross surrounding one of the galaxies in the cluster. Because each light ray follows a different path from the star to here, each image in the cross represents a slightly different moment in the supernova explosion.” [Dennis Overbye, 5 March 2015 (NYTimes)]</p>
