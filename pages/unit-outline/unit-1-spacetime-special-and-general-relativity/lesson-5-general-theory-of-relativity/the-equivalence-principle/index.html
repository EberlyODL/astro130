<p>One day in November 1907, Einstein had the “happiest thought of his life” that led to the development of general theory of relativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern, when all of a sudden a thought occurred to me: ‘If a person falls freely, he will not feel his own weight</em>.’”</p>
<p>This is called Equivalence principle!&nbsp; Whenever you feel weight (as opposed to being weightless), you are either accelerating or you feel gravity. In Lesson 3, we talked about weightlessness and looked closely at an example of astronauts.&nbsp; The astronauts are weightless because they are in free-fall around Earth.&nbsp; Here, we will examine the consequences of this realization.&nbsp; The equivalence principle means that it is not possible to distinguish whether you are accelerating or you are in a gravitational field.&nbsp; In other words:</p>
<p>“<span class="#ff0000-text"><span class="red-text"><span class="teal-text"><strong>The effects of gravity are exactly equivalent to the effects of acceleration</strong>.</span></span></span>” [1].</p>
<p>To further investigate the meaning of this statement, we will use another thought experiment.&nbsp; Imagine that Jackie’s friend, Giancarlo, is sitting inside a room that has closed and shut windows and doors.&nbsp; Without his knowledge, we magically remove his room from Earth and send it through space with an acceleration of 1<em>g</em> (see figure).&nbsp; He still feels the floor beneath his feet and he doesn’t suspect anything other than being on Earth’s surface.&nbsp; However, according to the equivalence principle, Giancarlo would have no way of telling that he left Earth.&nbsp; The acceleration of 1<em>g</em> that he feels can be due to a gravitational field or to acceleration through space.</p>

<p>Notice that in Special Relativity, we used examples of spaceships moving at constant velocities and frames of reference where there was <em>no force</em> or acceleration. We saw that time was dilated, lengths contracted and mass increased for objects traveling at relativistic speeds. It turns out that there are&nbsp;three consequences of the Equivalence principle:</p>
<ol><li>Gravitational time dilation</li><li>Gravitational redshift</li><li>Gravitational lensing (light deflection)</li></ol>
