<h2>Testing Gravitational Redshift and Time Dilation</h2>
<p>1) Precession of Mercury</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;the 1800s, it has been known that Mercury’s orbit precesses around the Sun and that the effect is due to the gravitational influence of the other planets on Mercury (see Figure).</p>

<p>Precise observations of Mercury’s orbit were obtained in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but calculations with Newton’s laws of gravitation could not completely account for the amount of precession. The problem is that Newton’s view of gravity assumes that space is flat and that time is absolute, when in fact, time runs more slowly at the part of Mercury’s orbit that is closer to the Sun (perihelion). In other words, spacetime is more curved in the part of the orbit that is close to the Sun than the part of Mercury’s orbit that is farther from the Sun (aphelion). Einstein was able to correctly calculate this effect with general relativity. When, after 8 years, he finally solved this puzzle of Mercury’s orbit, he was so excited that he couldn’t work for the next three days.</p>
<p>2) Numerous experiments have been conducted showing that clocks at different altitudes tick at slightly different rates proving gravitational time dilation.</p>
<p>3) Spectral lines on stars appear slightly redshifted because the gases that are creating the lines are in a stronger gravitational field than we are on Earth. Famous experiments proving gravitational redshift include: Pound-Rebka experiment (1960) and Spectrum of the Sun (1962).</p>
<p>4) Accuracy of the GPS devices depends on calculations that take the gravitational time dilation into account. GPS technology relies on accurate <strong>synchronization of the clocks in the Global Positioning System and clocks on the ground</strong>!</p>

<div class="question"><p>In what way does special relativistic time dilation affect the GPS?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>Special relativistic time dilation - GPS satellites are East-bound and move with respect to the ground. This effect makes the GPS satellites’ clocks run slower by 7 micro-second/day.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="question"><p>In what way does gravitational time dilation affect the GPS?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>Gravitational time dilation - GPS satellites are found at a high altitudes where gravity is weaker, so the clocks on the GPS run faster by 45 micro-seconds per day.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="question"><p>What is the net effect on position/time in the GPS?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>The combined effect of time running slower due to the motion of the satellites with respect to Earth and time running faster at high altitudes is 45 – 7 = 38 micro-seconds/day. If both effects were not accounted for, GPS would give us positions that are off by 10 km/day!</p></li></ol></div>
