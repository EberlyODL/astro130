<h2>(also known as Light Deflection)</h2>
<p>When starlight passes near a massive object like the Sun, its path is bent making the source appear to be in a slightly different position than it should be. This effect was first observed during a Solar eclipse in 1919 by Sir Arthur Eddington. Eddington observed a pair of stars whose separation was well known during a solar eclipse when one of the stars was lensed by the Sun. The lensed star’s position (star A in Figure is closer to the Sun), was slightly shifted and the separation between the two stars appeared to be smaller than previously measured.</p>

<p>Eddington’s solar eclipse expedition confirmed General Relativity and made Einstein a celebrity, overnight. It turned out that the experiment was not accurate enough – the uncertainty in the measurement was larger than the result. A similar solar eclipse experiment that was done in the 1967 and it did in fact confirm general relativity.</p>
<p>Today, with advancements in telescope and camera technology we see many examples of gravitational lensing. You saw a number of lensed galaxies or supernovae in a previous section.</p>
