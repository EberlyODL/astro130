<p>General relativity predicts that movements of a massive object can produce gravitational waves just as movements of a charged particle produce light waves.</p>
<p><strong>What are gravitational waves?</strong></p>
<p>They are ripples in spacetime that propagate through spacetime as waves. &nbsp;They are caused when something changes spacetime - in a sense when something jostles spacetime. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;examples include merging black holes, or colliding neutron stars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before gravitational radiation has even been detected, there was&nbsp;indirect evidence for its existence. For example, the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary system which suggests gravitational waves are more than mathematical anomalies.</p>
<p>In 1974, Princeton professor Joe Taylor and his graduate student Russell Hulse discovered and observed extensively a binary pulsar, now known as PSR 1913+16. The binary pulsar, as its name implies, consists of two <strong>neutron stars </strong>revolving around each other, one of which is a <strong>pulsar</strong>. (We will review neutron stars in the next Unit). Pulse arrivals can be timed with exquisite accuracy. The pulse arrival times in PSR 1913+16 exhibit a periodic delay/advance resulting from the orbital motion. With high-precision pulse timing, Hulse and Taylor were able to derive the size of the orbit, the masses of the stars, and their velocities very accurately. By watching for a long time, they observed that the orbit is <strong>shrinking</strong>.</p>

<p>Because the orbit is shrinking, the binary system must be losing energy somehow. Hulse and Taylor realized that this loss could be gravitational radiation: the neutron stars accelerate as they orbit. Therefore, they calculated the gravitational-radiation loss expected from general relativity, for the stellar masses, orbital size, and speed. The GR result is in precise agreement with their measurements. This observation therefore constitutes the discovery of gravitational radiation, and an important experimental verification of general relativity. The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics went to Hulse and Taylor for this work.</p>

<p>All reproducible experiments to date have confirmed the predictions of Einstein’s relativity theories. In fact, few scientific theories are so well-supported by experiments. Scientists keep using the theory to predict new effects. Experimental tests of these newly-predicted effects are in many cases even sterner tests of the theories. Black holes were among the first of these “new effects” predicted by the general theory of relativity, though this was not recognized at the time.</p>
