<p>In Special Relativity, a person inside a freely falling frame of reference would observe light to travel in <strong><em>straight </em></strong> lines.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at an example of an elevator going up with a constant speed, assume no gravity. What will the light path look like to a person inside the elevator?</p>

<p>Light will actually appear to be slanted (but not bent). It will look like this:</p>

<p>The angle that the light beam makes with the wall of the elevator depends on the velocity of the elevator. Faster the elevator moves, the more slanted the angle of the light beam. You have actually all experienced this in real life, just in different circumstances.</p>
<div class="question"><p>You are in train and you are looking through the window where it is raining. Which figure represents the train at rest? Which figure represents the train moving at the fastest speed out of the three?</p>

<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Figure A</a>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, the train is at rest in figure A. The train at B. is moving at a relatively slow speed – let’s say about 30 km/h. The train in figure C. is moving pretty fast – at 250 km/h..</p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">Figure B</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">Figure C</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li></ol></div>
<p>But, what does the path of a light beam look like in an accelerated elevator, in other words—in a gravitational field?</p>
<p>It turns out that the light path is curved!</p>

<p>Light rays are curved in accelerating frames of reference. Because the equivalence principle tells us that acceleration is equivalent to gravity, this must mean that <em>gravity attracts light</em>. But then we run into a paradox:<strong> How can gravity attract light if light has no mass?</strong></p>
<p>This is where the mass-energy equivalence comes into play.</p>
<p><strong>Mass-Energy Equivalence:</strong></p>
<p font-size="1.5em"><lrn-math>E=mc^2\</lrn-math></p>
<p><em>Energy can be converted into mass and mass into energy – mass and energy are equivalent</em>. You have seen this in Astro 1, and more specifically in nuclear fusion reactions in the Sun where 4 Hydrogen nuclei are combined to make one Helium nucleus.</p>
<p font-size="1.5em"></p>
<p font-size="1.5em"><lrn-math>{\text{4H}}\ {\rightarrow} \ {\text{He}} + {\text{energy}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>The reason that so much energy is released in this reaction is because the left hand side of the equation has slightly more mass than the right hand side. The “missing mass” must then be converted to energy.</p>
<p>The warping of space-time by the Sun causes light to bend around the Sun. The figure below shows how light from background stars is bent by gravity of the Sun. When observed from Earth, a distant star that appears to be in the direction of the Sun on the sky is actually behind the Sun. Because spacetime around the Sun is curved, the light from the distant star is bent and it looks like it is coming form a direction slightly different than its real position.</p>

<p>If gravity can bend light, then we also expect it to affect the energy of light. Recall that energy and wavelength of light are closely related. Because gravity can extract energy from escaping matter, then it also extracts energy from escaping light. This brings us to the next topic – gravitational redshift – which we will examine around black holes.</p>
