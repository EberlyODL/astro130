<p></p><h3>What is Gravity according to Newton?</h3><p></p><p>In simple terms, gravity is an attractive <strong>force</strong> that acts between two objects.</p><p>Any object that has mass pulls on all other objects in the universe that have mass. We call this force gravity.</p><p></p><p>The force of gravity depends on the masses of the two bodies, and their separation squared;</p><ul><li>the larger the mass, the greater the attraction;</li><li>the larger the separation, the smaller the attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">F-3-1</div><div class="figurelabel__desc">The Force of Gravity</div></div><p><img src="assets/earthdiagram-1.jpg" width="1944" height="1321" alt=""></p><div class="question"><p>Which diagram is correct?</p><ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Diagram 1</a><p><strong>Yes</strong>, since Earth is more massive than the Moon, the arrow pointing toward Earth should be longer than the one pointing toward the Moon.
