<p>Einstein showed that space and time are not independent, but are inextricably linked in a four-dimensional entity called <strong>spacetime</strong>.&nbsp; Spacetime is the four-dimensional combination of space and time that forms the “fabric” of our universe.</p>
<p>The universe has three spatial dimensions (length, width, height) and one time dimension. &nbsp;Observers in relative motion do not share the same definitions of length, width, height and time (<em>x, y, z,</em> and <em>t)</em>, taken individually:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Space is different for different observers.</em></p>
<p><em>Time is different for different observers.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spacetime is the same for everyone.</strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, a book has a definite three-dimensional shape. But the book looks different in two-dimensional pictures of the book taken from different perspectives.</p>
<div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">F-3-7</div>
<div class="figurelabel__desc">Book Dimensions</div></div>

<p></p>
<p>Similarly, space and time look different from different perspectives in spacetime.</p>

<p>It is impossible for us to picture four dimensions, as we are used to 3D.&nbsp; However, we can use an example with two dimensions, like a rubber sheet, where by curving the rubber sheet, we can picture an extra dimension.&nbsp;</p>
