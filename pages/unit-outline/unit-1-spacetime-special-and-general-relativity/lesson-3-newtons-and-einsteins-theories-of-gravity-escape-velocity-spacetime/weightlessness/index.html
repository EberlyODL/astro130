<p>You feel weight because of Newton’s second&nbsp;law (F = m a).&nbsp; Gravity is pulling you down, but the ground is not allowing you to fall.&nbsp; It must therefore be exerting a force on you to keep you from falling.&nbsp; That force is the weight that you feel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you were allowed to fall, you would not feel any weight. So <strong>when you are in free-fall, you feel weightlessness</strong>. Since objects that are in orbit around Earth, for example, are constantly falling and are therefore weightless.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>When you are in an orbit, you are weightless. </em></p>

<div class="question"><p>Astronauts in the space station feel weightless because:</p>
<ol><li class="incorrect"><a href="#">There is no gravity in space.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#" style="">They have achieved escape velocity from Earth's gravity.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="incorrect"><a href="#" style="">They are above Earth's atmosphere.</a>
<p><strong>No</strong></p></li><li class="correct"><a href="#">They, along with the space station, are falling toward Earth.</a>

<p>Have you committed to an answer?&nbsp; I am serious! Research shows that if you don't commit to an answer, the result of the demonstration will not be as meaningful or memorable to you.</p>

<p>The most popular answers to this question are usually 1.&nbsp;and 2. &nbsp;Let's consider those for a moment. What keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth?&nbsp;And what keeps the space shuttle in orbit? &nbsp;What keeps&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;in orbit around anything else: all the planets in our solar system, stars in a galaxy? I hope you said gravity. Gravity keeps all those things together, despite plenty of empty space between them. So YES, there is PLENTY of gravity in space. Answers 1.&nbsp;and 2.&nbsp;are just plain wrong.</p>
<p>The astronauts have NOT achieved anything like escape velocity -- if they had, they would be escaping from the Earth: traveling on a trajectory away, never to return.</p>
<p>Being above the atmosphere has nothing to do with it either. The astronauts that orbited the Moon experienced the exact same thing, and the Moon has no atmosphere. And the atmosphere does nothing to turn Earth's gravity&nbsp;<em>off</em>&nbsp;-- as just discussed, there is plenty of gravity above the atmosphere, in outer space.</p>
<p>So by process of elimination, the only answer option left is 4. And this is the correct answer. And in fact, the astronauts (and space station) aren't just falling any old way; they are in&nbsp;<em><u>freefall</u></em>: falling under the influence of gravity only, with nothing to stop the fall.</p>
<p>The feeling of weightlessness is experienced by anyone or anything in freefall. It is a sensation of having no surface pushing up against you (like the chair you're probably sitting on right now) to stop your fall. In the case of astronauts in orbit, their speed is not changing, but their direction is, as they are constantly "falling" around the Earth. So they experience uninterrupted freefall and thus weightlessness.</p>

<h3>Newton’s and Einstein’s Understanding of Gravity</h3>
<p>In Newton’s view, gravity exerts a force, which keeps objects in orbit.&nbsp; Isaac Newton saw gravity as a mysterious “force.”&nbsp; He had problems accepting this concept of “action at a distance” as he couldn’t explain how the force of gravity is transmitted through space.</p>
<p>Einstein removed the mystery by showing that <em>what we perceive as gravity arises from curvature of spacetime.</em> Einstein theorized that the “force” of gravity arises from distortions of spacetime itself!</p>
