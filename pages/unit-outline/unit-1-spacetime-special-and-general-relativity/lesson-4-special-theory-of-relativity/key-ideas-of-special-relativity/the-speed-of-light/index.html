<h3>About the Speed of Light</h3>
<p>Ever since Einstein established the Theory of Special Relativity, many experiments have verified the following properties of light:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Speed of light is constant for every reference frame. </strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>No material object can travel faster than light</strong></li></ul>
<p>To see why the first one is surprising, we will use our common sense from the previous part on relative motion.</p>
<p>In the figure below, you see a stationary observer, an airplane flying at 900 km/h, and a passenger in the airplane who is rolling a ball at 10 km/h in the same direction the plane is flying.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<div class="question"><p>What is the speed of the ball relative to the passenger on the plane?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>The passenger thinks of himself as stationary and in his reference frame the ball is moving at 10 km/h.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="question"><p>What is the speed of the ball relative to the stationary observer?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>The stationary observer sees the ball moving at 910 km/h. Because the airplane and the ball are moving in the same direction she must add the ball's velocity to the velocity of the airplane.</p></li></ol></div>
<p>Does the same example apply to light?</p>
<p>Figure F-4-3&nbsp;shows the passenger on the plane shining a flashlight in the same direction the airplane is moving.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The speed of light from the flashlight relative to the passenger is just the speed of light – 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s (1.08 x 10<sup>9</sup> km/h).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<div class="question"><p>What velocity does the stationary observer measure for the flashlight?</p>
<ol><li class="correct"><a href="#">Reveal Answer</a>
<p>299,792,458 m/s, see below</p></li></ol></div>
<p>Using the same arguments as before we would say: <em>900 km/h + c</em>.</p>
<p>But this is <strong>not correct</strong>! The speed of light is the same for everyone, so the observer measures exactly 299,792,458 m/s for the speed of the light coming from the flashlight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why? It turns out that this is the way in which nature works (or laws of physics in our universe). <strong>The speed of light is absolute</strong> and this has been verified through many experiments and observations!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Why Can Nothing Travel Faster than the Speed of Light?</u></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the previous part, you saw that the speed of light is constant and that this was established through numerous experiments and observations. It then follows that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Lets see why. The following example is from [1].</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets say that you have a very fast spaceship and that you are trying to catch up to your own headlights. From your reference frame, you would always measure the speed of your light beams to be <em>c</em> (because the speed of light is absolute) and you would never be able to catch up to them. Because you can never outrace your headlights, you can never travel at or faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figurelabel"><div class="figurelabel__title">F-4-4</div>
<div class="figurelabel__desc">Spaceship Example 1</div></div>
<p><img src="assets/s2_09_figure-anno.jpg" width="988" height="1080" alt=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Observers outside of your reference frame would always measure your headlights to move at <em>c</em>, and they would always see the headlights moving ahead of you. Because the speed of light is absolute and you are always behind the headlights, your speed must be <em>slower</em> than <em>c</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, no material object can travel at the speed of light. The closer an object’s velocity is to the speed of light, the harder it gets to accelerate the object near <em>c</em>. The object will appear to be heavier and heavier - later in the lesson you will see that an object’s mass increases, the faster it moves.</p>
