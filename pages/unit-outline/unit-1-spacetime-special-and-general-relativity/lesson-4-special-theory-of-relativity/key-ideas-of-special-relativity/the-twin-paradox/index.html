<p>Suppose that our friend Jackie has a twin sister who lives on Earth.&nbsp; One day Jackie decides to visit a&nbsp;star called&nbsp;Vega which is 25 light years away. Jackie takes her amazingly fast spaceship and travels to Vega at 0.999 c.&nbsp; From the point of view of her twin sister on Earth, how long will it take Jackie to return? It is as simple as it seems, it will take Jackie 50 years to return to Earth (25 years to get to Vega and 25 years to get back from Vega).&nbsp; How much time will pass for Jackie?</p><p></p><p>Here we have to use the time dilation equation.&nbsp; Since 50 years pass&nbsp;on Earth (in the rest-frame), we will need to calculate the time in the moving reference frame.</p><p>&nbsp;<lrn-math>{t}_{moving}=t_{rest}{\sqrt{1-({\frac{\text{v}}{\text{c}}{)}^2}}}\)</p><p>\({t}_{moving}={50}{\sqrt{1-({0.999})^2}}\)</p><p>\({t}_{moving}=\&nbsp;2.2\ {\text{yr}}\)</p><p>So, only about 2 years will pass for Jackie while 50 years pass for her twin sister.&nbsp; This means that Jackie, after her trip, would have aged only 2 years, while her twin sister would have aged 50 years.</p><p></p><p>Remember that from Jackieâ€™s point of view on the spaceship, her spaceship is not going anywhere.&nbsp; It is the Earth that rushes away from her and Vega rushes toward her at 0.999c.&nbsp; Jackie will therefore find the distance from Earth to Vega contracted from its rest length of 25 light years (with the length contraction formula</lrn-math> to 1.1 light years. Because Vega is traveling toward Jackie at 0.999c and has only 1.1 ly to travel, Jackie will be at Vega in just about 1.1 year. &nbsp;The round trip back to Earth would take Jackie only 2.2 years.&nbsp;</p>
