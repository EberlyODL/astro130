<p>A consequence of special relativity is also that mass increases for objects moving close to the speed of light. We will rely on our friend Jackie, one more time, to help us understand this [1]. However, we will also need help from her twin sister who has an identical spaceship as Jackie and you. Imagine that Jackie’s twin sister and you are stationary in the same reference frame, while Jackie is moving at 0.95<em>c</em> (see Figure F-4-10).</p>

<p></p>
<p>The instant Jackie’s ship reaches you and lines up with her twin’s ship, you push both of them with the same force for the same amount of time. Will your equally applied force accelerate their spaceships by the same amount?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, the answer is not as simple as yes or no. Because Jackie is moving close to the speed of light, we must now use our new relativity-thinking hat and remember that Jackie’s time is ticking slower than it is for you and her twin (as the two of you are stationary). In this case, the amount of time you applied the force to push Jackie is actually <em>shorter</em> than the amount of time you pushed her twin sister. If you apply the same force on both Jackie and her twin sister, but Jackie’s velocity is less affected, then her mass must be <em>greater </em>than her sister’s.</p>
<p>This effect is called the mass increase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another way to think of mass increase is&nbsp;to think of it as an object’s resistance to being accelerated close to the speed of light. In Newton’s Law equation: <strong><em>F = m a</em></strong> (where <em>F</em> is the force, <em>m</em> is the mass, and <em>a</em> is acceleration)</p>
<p>the object’s mass serves as the equation’s constant. In a relativistic universe, objects have an unchanging <strong><em>rest mass</em></strong>, but the mass increases according to the velocity of the object.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>As an object accelerates, its resistance to that acceleration increases, showing up in the equation as an increase in the objects mass. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p>These effects only become significant at speeds comparable to the speed of light. To Einstein they meant that some other constant is at work and that is the speed of light!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The formula for mass increase:</p>
<p></p>
<p><lrn-math>{m}_{moving}=\frac{\text{m}_{rest}}{\sqrt{1-({\frac{\text{v}}{\text{c}}{)}^2}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p>where <em>m<sub>moving</sub></em> is the mass in a moving reference frame and <em>m<sub>rest</sub></em> the mass in a stationary reference frame.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>How significant is the mass increase at velocities close to the speed of light?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The higher the mass of an object the more difficult it is to get it to travel close to the speed of light, so lets test this on something with a small mass.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is the mass of a fly traveling at 0.9999<em>c</em> with rest mass of 1 gram? [1]</p>
<p><lrn-math>{m}_{moving}=\frac{\text{m}_{rest}}{\sqrt{1-({\frac{\text{v}}{\text{c}}{)}^2}}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><lrn-math>{m}_{moving}=\frac{\text{1 g}}{\sqrt{1-{(0.9999)}^2}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p><lrn-math>{m}_{moving}={\text{70.7 g}}\</lrn-math></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Notice that the fly is moving very close to the speed of light and its mass increases by a factor of 70 (wow!) compared to its rest mass.&nbsp;</p>
