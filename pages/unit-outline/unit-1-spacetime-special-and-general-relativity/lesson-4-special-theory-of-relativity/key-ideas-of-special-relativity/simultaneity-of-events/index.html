<p>Simultaneous events.... or are they?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Order and simultaneity of events depends on oneâ€™s reference frame.</em></strong></p>

<p>Example Problem<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Your friend Jackie is in her spaceship and is traveling directly toward you at 0.9<em>c</em>. She is sitting in the middle of the spaceship inside which the only lights are a flashing green light at the front end of the ship and a flashing red light at its back end. <u>At the instant that Jackie flies by you</u>, you see the green and the red flashes occurring at exactly the same time.</p>
<div class="question"><p>Which flash will reach Jackie first (in your reference frame)? (<span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Hint:&nbsp;it will help you to&nbsp;draw a picture before you answer the following questions. )</span></p>

<p>Green because she is traveling toward it.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="question"><p>Which flash will Jackie see first, in her reference frame? (<span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Hint: Jackie considers herself to be stationary in her spaceship.)</span></p>

<p>Jackie considers herself to be stationary in the center of her spaceship. So the only way that the green light can reach her before the red light is, if the green flash occurred first. She must see the green light flash first, and the red one, a short time later.</p></li></ol></div>
