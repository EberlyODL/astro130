<h3>Why Do We Need Relativity?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For standard situations like throwing a ball up in the air and describing how and when it will fall down, Newton’s
  Laws work just fine. However, when we talk about the behavior of an electron in an atom, or the gravitational field of
  a black hole or even our GPS systems, Newton’s laws are <u>not</u>
  accurate enough and we need Special & General Relativity. Newton’s Laws are actually an approximation and the
  inaccuracies we introduce by using them are so small that they don’t matter for everyday situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Astronomical situations where we encounter huge masses, densities, or velocities near the speed of light we need
  to use Special & General Relativity to explain such behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>
</p>
<div class="question">
  <p>Einstein said that everything is relative.</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="incorrect"><a href="#">True</a>
      <p><strong>No</strong>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="correct"><a href="#">False</a>
      <p>Einstein said that <strong><u>motion</u>
        </strong>
        is relative; i.e., there isn’t one preferred frame of reference from which to view it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What does it mean when we say that something is relative?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the example in the following Figure.</p>
<div class="figurelabel">
  <div class="figurelabel__title">F-4-1</div>
  <div class="figurelabel__desc">Moving Train Example</div>
</div>

<p>Remember to commit to an answer of these and all the subsequent questions within the lessons BEFORE you move on to
  the next part. Yes, even if they are easy or really hard. Research shows that if you don't commit to an answer, the
  example will not be as meaningful or memorable to you.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>
</p>
<div class="question">
  <p>How fast is the train moving relative to the stationary observer?</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#">Reveal the answer</a>
      <p>The train is moving at 40 mph with respect to the stationary observer.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Question 3</strong>
</p>
<div class="question">
  <p>How fast is the ‘walker’ moving relative to the train?</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#">Reveal the answer</a>
      <p>The walker is moving 10 mph with respect to the train.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Question 4</strong>
</p>
<div class="question">
  <p>How fast is the ‘walker’ moving relative to the stationary observer?</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#">Reveal the answer</a>
      <p>Since the train and the walker are moving in opposite directions, a stationary observer must subtract their
        velocities. The observer would see the walker moving at 40 mph – 10 mph = 30 mph.</p>
      <p><em>Motion is relative because it depends on whom or what it is measured relative to</em>
      </p>
