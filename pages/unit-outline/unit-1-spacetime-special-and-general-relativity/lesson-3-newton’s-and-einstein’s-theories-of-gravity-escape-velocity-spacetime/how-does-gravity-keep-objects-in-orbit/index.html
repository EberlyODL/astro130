<p>Can we fire a cannonball and get it to orbit the Earth? Let’s launch a cannonball with an initial velocity <strong>v.</strong>&nbsp; The path the cannonball would take is <strong>curved</strong>.</p>

<p>If the cannonball is fired at higher speeds, it falls to ground much further away…</p>

<p>Eventually, the cannonball is fast enough that it “falls” to Earth at the same pace that Earth’s surface curves. The cannonball is then in<strong> a <u>circular orbit</u> around the Earth!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This interactive demonstration illustrates what would happen if you launched a cannonball from a high mountain on the Earth and let it fall solely under the influence of gravity (ignoring air resistance and mountains).</p>

<ul><li>First, launch the cannonball at the lowest speed the applet allows, 0.01 km/s, and click "Fire". This is treated as essentially zero speed, so the cannonball falls straight down.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Now use the slider bar to kick the speed up one level: increase the speed to 1 km/s, "Reload", and "Fire" again. Notice that the cannonball is launched horizontally due to the kick of the gunpowder, parallel to the Earth's surface, and travels a fair horizontal distance - while simultaneously falling vertically due to gravity - before hitting the ground. You will notice the same outcome as you increase the speed of the cannonball to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 km/s.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Now launch the cannonball at 8 km/s. It now misses all the comparable-height mountains, and continues falling around the Earth until... it comes back to where it started. And then there is nothing to stop it, so it just keeps falling, around and around, forever. That is exactly what an&nbsp;<u>orbit</u>&nbsp;is: one object perpetually&nbsp;<em>falling</em>&nbsp;around another, never hitting. And you could achieve it with any projectile (ignoring air resistance) if you could give it enough sideways launch velocity that, as it fell, the surface curved away from the sideways path enough that it never actually hits. It is perpetually falling toward Earth... and perpetually&nbsp;<em>missing</em>&nbsp;it!</li></ul>
<ul><li>What kind of orbit does the cannonball have at 9, 10 and 11 km/s?</li></ul>
<ul><li>At what velocity would the cannonball escape Earth’s gravity and never return?</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on the initial velocity of an object launched from Earth, its orbit can be circular, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic (see Figure F-3-6).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>If the initial velocity is larger than a certain threshold value, an object can completely escape the Earth’s gravitational pull.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
